## Marble Simulation (2018-2019)
My first long-term project. The aim was a build-your-own marble run simulation utilising Python in an OOP manner. As my first large project from scratch the experience was valuable in improving my debugging and creative capabilities.

## Planeswalker Game (2020-2021)
A first year project for university. The game was created in the p5.js web developer with the intention of creating a simple platformer with level progression and tutorial aspects. 5 levels were created and the method for implementation meant that further levels could be added with correctly formatted CSV files.

## Machine Learning And Optimisation Coursework (2021)
The larger part of the coursework for my Comp2002 module. The task was about optimising a timetable in python utilising simple machine learning techniques. This was one of my highest achieving modules partially due to my particular interest and mathematical capabilities.
